\subsection{Audio module design}

As described under the analysis, the audio module has to be capable of both
generating sounds and playing predefined wave-files. The processor is chosen to
run in real-time with a frequency of 44kHz, this is done to reduce aliasing
artifacts - in theory this is enough to allow an output spanning the full
audible range, given sufficient filtering and taking care not to generating any
tones above the nyquist-frequency; we did however not have the time to dive
fully into this theory and thus some aliasing will occur.

The design of the audio module will be done like a digital model of a modular
synthesizer, taking inspiration from eg. the free-to-try software
\emph{SynthEdit0} in which different block (oscillators, filters, transient
generators, wave-file players etc.) can be connected to form whole synthesizers.
See figure:~\ref{fig:synthedit}.

This approach allows for both easy programming of the modules, as this becomes
an highly manageable problem; easy programming of the synthesizers, this is just
connecting the blocks; and provides an easily expandable and reusable library.

Communication is done over SPI, using MIDI (\emph{Musical Instrument Digital
Interface}) commands. This allows for a MIDI interpreter module, working in
similar ways as all other modules.
