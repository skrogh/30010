\subsection{Implementation of main function}

The modules can now be connected as described under the \emph{Design} section.
The trigger signal is gated by the \emph{LFO} tick before entering the
\emph{OneShotter}s. A flow diagram for the main function is presented in
figure~\ref{fig:mainflow}

function.}{fig:mainflow}

Application specific data is also kept at the top level, constant arrays with
wave files, scores for the sequencers are stored in header files, while the
instruments in use both have header and \emph{.c} file.
