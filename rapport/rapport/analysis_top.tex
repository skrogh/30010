\section{Analysis}
As the game must be made to run on an eZ8 microcontroller, with limited performance capabilities, and display graphics in a terminal
 via ANSI commands sent over a relatively low bandwidth UART connection, performance must be taken into consideration and bottlenecks identified. \\

Generating the sound needed for background music and sound effects is a performance heavy task that we deemed
impossible to implement purely on the eZ8 microcontroller.
Therefore, the sound generation is offloaded to a Stellaris Launchpad microcontroller. 
This will then recieve commands from the eZ8 using SPI, such that the game running on the eZ8 can control
what sounds are being generated by the stellaris.\\

Displaying background images requires a lot of ANSI escape codes to be sent over the UART communication with
the terminal used for graphics. This is due to complex graphics having many different colors. As the UART on the eZ8 
development board is only capable of sending data at 115200Baud, this issue must be taken into account
in the software responsible for graphics if a new picture is to be rendered 30 times a second. \\

To make use of a joystick for controlling the striker it will also be necessary to use the ADC on the eZ8 development
board.
