\subsection{Audio module implementation}

The structure of the program deviates a bit from the three layers described in
\cite{Lect2} on slide 9, there is no application interface layer - as seen in
figure:~\ref{fig:overview}

\stdfig{0.8}{audiomodule/overview}{Block diagram of overall program
structure}{fig:overview}

The two main reasons for this is:
\begin{itemize}
  \item There are very few functions in this layer - a
layer more would just be a pass-through layer.
  \item For testing the application had to be ported to \emph{Windows}
\end{itemize}
