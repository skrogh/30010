\subsection{Game Testing}
Game testing was mostly done manually, by visual inspection of the game behaviour and
aid from the debugger. The game code was slightly modified to force edges cases to
occur so that time would not be wasted on waiting for them to happen naturally.
 This is of course not the most optimal way to test software,
however, for a game it is necessary. While unit and integration tests would have been helpful, and
would most definitely be included if we were to redo the project, manual game
testing would still need to be performed. The game testing also served a 
secondary purpose, besides verifying that the software was working as intended.
It allowed us to tweak the gameplay based on how good the game felt to actually play. \\

The SPI module was tested and debugged using a logic analyzer program for the stellaris 
launchpad.
