\begin{abstract}
In this report we present the design and implementation of an arkanoid clone
called Smashing Bricks, that runs on an eZ8 microcontroller, displays graphics
in a terminal on a PC by transmitting ANSI codes over a UART, and plays sound
effects and a backing track generated by a Stellaris Launchpad microcontroller
that receives commands from the eZ8 over an SPI connection. The game also
includes ASCII art backgrounds generated from raster images and runs at
30 frames per second in a terminal. We show what
design considerations were made and how they were implemented in broad terms,
using flow charts and block diagrams to show control flow and connections
between modules.
We do not present a line by line walkthrough of the written code as
it is included in the appendix. The final design is a modular and easily
extensible design that contains three independent abstraction layers for
both the eZ8 and \emph{Stellaris Launchpad}. In the end we present screenshots
and a description of the gameplay.
