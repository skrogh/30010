Went well:
Generation multivoice music.
Digital resonant filter
wave player

not so well:
could not run bandwith limmited waveshaper
not enough processing power (or unoptimized code) for filter on all voices
more voices would be nice

future work
Optimize the wave shaper so interpolation becomes a reasonable option
change to use of maloc
